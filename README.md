## 🧠 Overview

In today’s data-driven world, Computer Science (CS) degrees are in high demand across industries. For my final project in the Database Systems course at Ithaca College, I explored enrollment trends in the Ithaca College Computer Science (ICCS) program. The central question guiding my project was:

> **“How have enrollment trends in the CS program at Ithaca College changed over time, and what factors influence these trends?”**

This project involved designing a MySQL database to organize over 4,000 records of student, course, and enrollment data—transitioning from a less efficient Google Sheets setup to a more robust relational database model.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **MySQL** – Data storage, schema design, and query analysis
- **D3.js** – Dynamic, interactive data visualizations
- **Google Sheets** – Initial raw dataset
- **SQL** – Querying and analytics

## 📌 Key Questions & Insights

### ➤ 1. Course Progression Analysis
- **Query:** How likely is a student who completes COMP-110 to also complete COMP-220?
- **Result:** 5.48% continuation rate.
- **Insight:** COMP-110 serves as an introductory gateway, but few students continue to COMP-220—indicating potential gaps in interest, support, or scheduling.

### ➤ 2. COVID Impact on Enrollment
- **Query:** Was there a percentage change in COMP-171 enrollment post-COVID?
- **Result:** 5.16% **increase** in enrollment.
- **Insight:** Indicates renewed interest in tech education post-pandemic and the broader appeal of computational skills.

### ➤ 3. Non-CS Majors Taking CS Courses
- **Query:** What are the top CS course loads among non-CS majors/minors?
- **Result:** Students majoring in **Physics** and **Mathematics**, and minoring in **Data Science**, took the most CS courses.
- **Insight:** Strong interdisciplinary demand for CS knowledge from analytical fields.

## 📈 Data Visualization

To better communicate these insights, I developed **interactive D3.js visualizations** that:
- Allow users to explore enrollment trends dynamically
- Show course popularity over time
- Reveal patterns in student progression

These visualizations make the data more accessible and enhance understanding for both technical and non-technical audiences.


---

## ✅ Conclusions

- **Introductory courses** like COMP-110 are vital, but retention toward upper-level CS courses remains low.
- Post-COVID interest in CS is growing, showing strong opportunities for expanding course offerings.
- **Non-CS majors’ engagement** highlights the interdisciplinary value of CS, suggesting room to develop targeted minors or cross-listed courses.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Expand dataset to include GPA, demographics, and course grades for deeper insights.
- Deploy visualizations online using GitHub Pages or an interactive dashboard.
- Collaborate with the CS department to implement strategies for increased course progression and retention.
